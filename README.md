A basic recipe app that uses MVVM architecture and latest Jetpack compose components. The project is a direct inspiration from [MVVM course](https://codingwithmitch.com/courses/jetpack-compose-mvvm-for-beginners/) by [Mitch Tabian](https://github.com/mitchtabian) and was built for the purpose of learning latest trends in Android Development.

## API:
The app communicates with [food2fork](https://food2fork.ca/) API which is also built by [Mitch Tabian](https://github.com/mitchtabian).

## Main Features of the Project:
1. MVVM
2. Jetpack Compose for UI
3. MutableState instead of LiveData
4. Dagger Hilt for DI
